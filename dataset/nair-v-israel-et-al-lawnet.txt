May 23,1923. Porter J.—
I see no reason to disagree with the finding of fact in this caseby the learned Magistrate that the accused, eight in number,were gambling with cards at a game called “ Baby.” I cannot,however, agree with him on the question of law that .the place wasa common gaming place. The police did not enter on a warrant,so the prosecution had to depend on proof that the place was one,to which the public had access.
The place where the gaming was taking place was an “ emptyroom in the railway lines or a room devoid, of furniture.” Inorder to sustain a conviction, the place must be such a place as thepublic have access to within the meaning of section 2 (a) of theOrdinance. A room in the railway lines is not such a place, andexcept for the tenant allowed by the Railway Company j it wouldappear that all the others would be trespassers. It therefore isnot a place to which the public had access within the meaning of theGaming Ordinance, 1889. On this ground the conviction is set aside.
Set aside.
