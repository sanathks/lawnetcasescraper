The plaintiff and the defendant are Muhammadan traders.They were engaged In a litigation—D. C. Galle, No. 11,704—on*questions of account. By deed No. 8,465 of May 21, 1914, theyagreed to refer the whole dispute to one of their ecclesiasticalauthorities, Sego Abdulameeh. The deed provided that, in the*event of either party refusing to be bound by the &apos;decision of thearbitrator, he should pay Bs. 10,000 damages to the party acceptingit. In -accordance with this agreement the action D. C. Galle,No. 11,704, was dismissed, and the arbitrator, after hearing the*parties, made his award, finding that a sum of Bs. 13,500 was due*by the defendant to the plaintiff. The present action is broughtby the plaintiff to enforce the award. The District Judge Has heldthat the plaintiff is entitled to Bs. 10,000 damages. The defendantappeals, and the plaintiff, by a notice of objections, contends thathe was entitled to judgment for the full sum awarded to him by thearbitrator. Various points were argued in the Court below. Butat the hearing of the appeal our attention was mainly directed to.

Thaha v.•Saibo
1016.the question whether an action of this character is maintainable.
Woor>It was strongly urged on behalf of the. defendant that, in the case
XIbiitov C.J. of voluntary references out of Court, the only remedy of the
successful party is to move, under- section 696 of the Civil ProcedureCode, within six months of the making of the award, and that theaward should be filed in Court. In support of this contention, itwas pointed out that section 29 of the Arbitration Ordinance, 1866,1which provides that, if there be np cause pending in Court, and thesubmission has not been made a rule of Court, the mode of enforcingthe award is by action on the bond of submission, has been repealedby the Civil Procedure Code, and also that the application bypetition in the way of summary procedure,, by which section 697of the Civil Procedure Code directs that&apos; application shall be made,is itself an “ action " in view of the provisions of sections 7 and 8-of the Code.
There is a.^ood deal of primd facie force in these contentions.But I do not think that we can give effect to them, in view of the.Indian authorities, including at least one decision by the . PrivyCouncil, on the corresponding provisions of section 525 of thd oldIndian Code of Civil Procedure. Under the Indian LimitationAct, 1877, applications under section 525 of the Civil ProcedureCode for the filing of an award had to. be made within a prescribedperiod. The Indian legislation on the point under consideration is,therefore, substantially identical with our own. In MuhammadNewaz Khan v. Alam Khan 2 the Privy Council held that the refusalof an application for the filing of an award under section 525 of -theCivil Procedure Code merely left the award to have its own ordinary rlegal effect, and the &apos;Indian Courts have consistently held that, inspite of the provisions of the Code of Civil-Procedure, an action liesto enforce a voluntary reference of the character with which we arehere concerned. See, for example, Palaniappa Ctietty v. RayajppaGhetty,3. Gopi Reddi v. Mahanandi Reddi,4 and Kunji Lai v. DurgaPrasad.5 I do not think that we should .be justified in attemptingto distinguish these authorities. The view taken by the learnedDistrict Judge of the law is, in my opinion, correct; but I see’, no
o.j
reason why the relief given to the plaintiff should be limited -toIts. 10,000. I would set aside the decree of the District Court, anddirect judgment to be entered up in favour of the plaintiff forIts. 13,500, with the costs of the action and of the appeal. &apos;
De Sampayo J.—I agree.
Defendant’s appeal dismissed.Cross appeal upheld.
