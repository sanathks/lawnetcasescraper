Cur. adv. vult.
November 24, 1909. Grenier J.—
The evidence in this case shows that all the appellants acted in -avery bold and high-handed manner in rescuing a drunken personwho was in the lawful custody of the complainant, the Police Vidaneof Latpandura. In my opinion the headman had a perfect right totake into his custody, without a warrant, a person whom he foundbehaving in a drunken and disorderly manner in a public thorough-fare. In this case the man who was rescued was not only drunkand disorderly, but had committed the offence of mischief bybreaking some furniture belonging to one Baba Singho.
I do not agree with the judgment of Withers J., reported in2 N. L. B. 149, that a police officer cannot arrest without a warranta person whom he finds to be drunk and disorderly in a public placeor thoroughfare. lu a footnote appended to the judgment referenceis made by the then editor of New Law Reports tb section 23 of theLicensing Ordinance, No. 12 of 1891, which empowers a police officerto take into his custody such a person and to keep him in his custodyuntil he becomes sober. I hold therefore that the police headmanin this case acted quite legally in taking into, his custody the personwho was subsequently rescued by the appellants.
[His Lordship then discussed the merits and dismissed theappeal.]
Judgment affirmed.
