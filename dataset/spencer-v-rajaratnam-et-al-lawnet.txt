Present: Wood Benton A.C.J. and Ennis J.SPENCEB v. BAJABATNAM et al.167—D. C. Colombo, 32,139.
Tesawalamai—Persona to whom the law applies—Inhabitants of Jaffna—
Domicil—Jaffna Tamils resident in Colombo.
The Tesawalamai is not a personal law in Ceylon as the Hinduor the Muhammadan law is in British India.
The Tesawalamai is not a personal law attaching itself by reasonof descent and religion to the whole Tamil population of Ceylon,but an exceptional custom in force in the Province of Jaffna—nowthe Northern Province—and in force there, primarily, and mainlyat any rate, only among Tamils who can be said to be ‘‘ inhabitants ”of that Province; as the Tesawalamai is a custom in derogationof the common law, any person who alleges that it is applicableto him must affirmatively establish the faot.
The mere faot that a man is a Jaffna Tamil by birth or by desoent,while it is a circumstance of which account must be taken inconsidering his real position, will not bring him within the scopeof the statutory definition of the class of persons to whom theTesawalamai applies.
Nothing but a Ceylon domioil can be acquired in Ceylon.
