D. M., being a simple creditor of J. H. Q., obtained judgment againsthim and caused the Fiscal to seize his share in a property cal.edUdupitiyagoda estate. At the sale in question D. M. became purchaserof his debtor’s share under deed dated 22nd January, 1885, which wa9registered on 1st February, 1887.
In 1881 J. H. G. and C. L. G., the joint ownera of the said estate, hadmortgaged it to J. P., who put the bond in suit on the 22nd November,1886, without making D. M. a party thereto. At the sale in execution ofthis mortgage decree, R. S. P. bought the whole estate under deeddated 24th September, 1887, which however was not registered till29th June, 1896, R. S. P. conveyed the estate to J. P. by deed dated11th November, 1891, and J. P.’s executor sold it to F. by deed dated25th March, 1895.
Held, in an action brought by D. M. against F. to recover possessionof the share bought by him under deed dated 22nd January, 1885, that,though the plaintiff had bought that share and registered his conveyanceprevious to the purchase and registration on the part of R. S. P., thedefendant’s predecessor in title, and though plaintiff Was no party tothe original hypothecary suit, yet the title of the defendant wassuperior to that of the plaintiff.
Per Monoreut, J.—As the conveyance tendered by the plaintifffor registration did not mention the real name of the land conveyed andassigned boundaries which could not be identified, so that the con-vevanee Was registered in the wrong book, I am inclined to think that itwas not registered, that the plaintiff was to blame for its non-registration,

and that his deed was void, under Ordinance No. 8 of 1863, section 39,as against the only registered deed of the defendants.
CTION rei vindicatio. Plaintiff alleged that J. H. Grenier
and C. Li Grenier were entitled to a land of about 142 acresby virtue of a Crown grant; that under a writ of executionissued against j. H. Grenier a defined portion of the said land wasseized and sold by the Fiscal on the 2nd July, when plaintiffbecame the purchaser thereof, and the Fiscal granted to him aconveyance dated 22nd January, 1885, which was -registered onthe 1st February, 1887; that the plaintiff was placed in possessionand continued to hold the land till the defendants took unlawfulpossession of the said portion in June, 1895. Plaintiff prayed forejectment of defendants and for a declaration of title in his favour.
The defendants pleaded that the Greniers had in 1881mortgaged the land in question to one Jeronis Peiris, and thatthe debt being unpaid the mortgage-creditor recovered judgmentagainst them and caused the Fiscal to sell the land, when It. S.Peiris became the purchaser under deed dated 24th September,1887, which was registered on 29th June, 1896; that E. S. Peirisconveyed it to Jeronis Peiris by deed dated 11th November,1891; that Jeronis Peiris died in 1894, and his executor sold theland to the second defendant, wife of the first defendant, by deeddated 25th March, 1895, since when they have been in possession.
The District Judge, after evidence heard, found that the Fiscal’sconveyance to E. S. Peiris, though dated 24th September, 1887,was not registered till June, 1896, till after Jeronis Peiris’sexecutor had sold the land to defendant on the 25th March, 1895,by a conveyance registered in June, 1895. He held that plaintiffshad proved their title to the land “ subject to considerations as tothe bond granted by the Greniers, the rival registrations, and thequestion of improvements made by the defendants.”
As regards these considerations, he was of the followingopinion:—
“As to the bond, it appears to me that the cases cited in 3 C.L.R.71 and 75 are entirely applicable, and that plaintiff’s title is not atall impaired by the fact that, when he purchased in execution ofhis money decree, the land was subject to a registered mortgagewhich was put in suit on 22nd November, 1886, after the Fiscalhad made conveyance to him of one of the mortgagor’s rights tothe land and before he had registered his conveyance. The onlyway in which their title, derived direct from the mortgagor, couldbe reached, reduced, and perhaps annihilated, would be by anhypothecary action and decree declaring the land liable to be madeexigible for satisfaction of the mortgagee’s writ.
