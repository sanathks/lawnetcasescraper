PINGYAR v. VALLASAMY.
44&—C. R. Colombo, 28,459.
Action nnder s. 247, Cm2 Procedure Code, in respect of a com—No voucherproduced by plaintiff—Proof of possession by plaintiff at date ofseizure—Burden of proving that plaintiff was not owner lies on thedefendant.
In an action by an unsuccessful claimant tinder section 247,Civil Procedure Code, for a declaration of title to a cow, and for adeclaration that the cow was not liable to be seized and sold underdefendant&apos;s writ, the plaintiff proved that he was in possession ofthe cow at the date of the seizure, but he produced no voucher toprove his purchase.
Held, that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed, as the defendanthad not proved that the judgment-debtor had a superior title.
&apos;J&apos;HE facts appear from the judgment.
Dc Jong, for the defendant, appellant.—The plaintiff asksfor declaration of title to a cow and calf. He has no voucher forthe cow. He cannot therefore maintain^this action. Don Davit v.Podi Sinno,l Ramaiya v. Sinno.2 Plaintiff cannot succeed bymerely showing that defendant is not the owner, and that someoneelse has a voucher in his name for the cow. To enable plaintiff tosucceed in this action plaintiff must have himself had title at thedate of seizure. Silva v. Kingoris,3 Silva v. Nonahamine.4
H. A. Jayewardcne (with him Kandiah)r for the respondent.—Ifthe Court finds, as it has found in this case, that the plaintiff was inpossession of the cow, the burden of proof that he is not the owner isshifted on to defendant. See Abayaratna v. Suppramaniam Chetty *
Do Jong, in reply.—The case cited does not apply to the facts ofthis case. That was a* land case; and in the case of land possessionis a very important element. But in this case the absence of avoucher is fatal to the plaintiff’s case.
