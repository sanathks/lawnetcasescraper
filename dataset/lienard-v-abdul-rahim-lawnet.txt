28th July, 1899. Withers, J.—
Appellant’s counsel has addressed me at least on one point oflaw, which was a very fit question for adjudication, and I listenedto him under the impression that it was contained in the petitionof appeal. I find that that is not the case. We can only hearargument on matters of law stated in the petition of appeal(section 840 (2) of Criminal Procedure Code).
On reading the petition of appeal, I find that only one matterof law is mentioned. That was hardly strong enough to bear theweight of a formal certificate. It amounted to this: the evidencerecorded shows that the complainant was to blame rather thanthe accused. That is a question of fact rather than of law.
