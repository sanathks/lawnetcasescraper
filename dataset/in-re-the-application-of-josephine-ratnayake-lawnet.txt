May 25,1921. Dz Sampayo J.—
This is a very extraordinary case. The appellant is a marriedwoman, and she applied by petition to the Court for a declarationthat her husband is dead. It appears that she married her husbandin 1907, and the husband left the Island in October, 1908, and wentto Singapore. She says in the petition that he deserted her, butprobably all that he did was to leave the Island in search of someemployment. Anyhow, the only communication he made to hiswife after he left Ceylon appears to have been early in 1909, whenhe wrote to her a letter from Singapore. This application is entirelymisconceived. It is supposed to have been in pursuance of section108 of the Evidence Ordinance, which is merely laying down a ruleof evidence that, if a husband is absent for a certain period withoutany information as to his whereabouts, for certain purposes hisdeath may be presumed. But nowhere is there any provision layingdown the procedure for obtaining a declaration of Court. Theonly way that the section of the Evidence Ordinance can.be availedof is by repelling any charge of bigamy that may be mad6 againsther if she marries again. But beyond that that section docs nothelp the appellant. I think the learned Judge is quite right insaying that he had no jurisdiction to grant the application.
The appeal is dismissed.
Schneider A.J.—I agree.
Appeal dismissed.
