■September 8and 9.
1897.
Giving false evidence—Procedure before conviction under Ordinance No. 9of 1895, 8. 12—Inconsistent statements.

HIS was an appeal from an order of the Magistrate, made
under the Oaths Ordinance, section 12, imposing a fine ofRs. 50 on the appellant for giving false evidence in a judicialproceeding.
