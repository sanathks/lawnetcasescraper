FTER the case for the prosecution had been closed, the Police
Magistrate recorded that the accused “did not call any“witnesses for the defence except Saris, who was not in the“ witness-shed at the time, but close to the court-house and heard“ all previous evidence. I decline to hear him.”
The accused having been convicted of voluntarily causing hurtunder section 314 of the Penal Code, they appealed.

The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the Court belowand sent back the case in order that the witnesses for the accusedmight be examined.
7th May, 1895. Lawrie, A.C.J.—
In my opinion it was irregular to refuse to allow the examina-tion of a witness for the accused merely because it was said thatthe witness had been close to the court-house during the trial,and had heard all the previous evidence. Taylor on Evidence,§ 1,260, states the law.
