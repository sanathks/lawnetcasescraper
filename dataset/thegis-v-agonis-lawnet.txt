The accused were charged in this case with having committedoriminal trespass in respect of a field which the complainant claimedto be his own. The Magistrate, after some inquiry, rightly cameto the conclusion that the case involved a civil dispute, and shouldbe settled in a civil court. But at the same time he examined aVidane Araohohi, and thought that the complainant had hadpossession previously, and, after discharging the accused, orderedthat the accused should bring a civil action, and as counsel for thecomplainant admitted, this means that the complainant was to berestored to possession as the result of this order and the accuseddriven to the civil court. The Magistrate had no right to makesuch an order as this, and in revision I set aside .the portion of theorder relating to possession and requiring the accused to bring anaction.
Set aside.
