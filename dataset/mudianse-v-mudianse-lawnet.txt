Plaintiff sued in 1893 on a mortgage bond executed in 1877. Nointerest in money had ever been paid on the bond, but in bar ofprescription plaintiff averred possession by him of the land mort-gaged in lieu of interest on a parol agreement with the debtor—
Held, that such an agreement, not being notarial, was of no forceor avail in law.
Held further by Withers and Browne, J.J. (Lawrie, J.,dissentiente), that possession under such agreement could notbe pleaded or proved in bar of prescription.
