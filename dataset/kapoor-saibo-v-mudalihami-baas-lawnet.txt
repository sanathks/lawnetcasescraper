D. C., Kandy, 14,387.
Prescription—Claim on an account stated and acknowledged—Ordinance No. SS
of 1871, ss. 8 and 18—“ Acknowledgment or promise by words only
Evidence—Paiol accounting.
An account stated maybe settledorally; but an acknowledgmentby
words only is insufficientto preventan action formoneydue uponan
account stated and thus acknowledged being barred under section 9 of theOrdinance No. 29 of 1871.
The plaintiff and defendant having had dealings with each other upto 23rd August, 1897, the defendant orally acknowledged on 19tbAugust, 1898, the accountstated byplaintiff, whichshowedthe debtsof
the defendant and occasional payments made byhim&apos; inreductionof
them. The account did not show mutual debts and mutual paymentsby way of set-off, and a conversion of the set-off into payments.
The plaintiff came into Court (with his claim for money due upon anaccount stated) on 1st February, 1901.
Held, that plaintiff could not maintain his action, because theacknowledgment of the defendant was a verbal one expressly declaredinsufficient by section 18 of the Ordinance No. 22 of 1871.
Ashby v. James (11 M. & W. 544), explained and distinguished, as alsoFernando v. Puncha (1 8. C. B. 1S3).
HE plaintiff claimed from the defendant the sum of Rs. 229 on
an account alleged to have been stated and acknowledged on19th August, 1898, and Rs. 82.81 as the value of goods sold anddelivered between 27th January and 5th March, 1900. The issuesagreed to between the parties at the trial were: —
Whether there was an accounting between the parties on19th August, 1898;
Whether a sum of Rs. 229.24 was then found to be due bydefendant to plaintiff; and
Whether the plaintiff thereafter sold and delivered goods todefendant as specified in the account filed with the plaint?
The District Judge delivered the following judgment: —
“ The plaintiff has sought to establish the accounting by paroleevidence. That evidence cannot be accepted as proving theaccounting. See D. C., Kandy, 90,241 (5 S. C. C. 169), and C. R.,Kandy, 425 (1 8. C. R. 123). I therefore answer the first and secondissues in the negative.
“ The rest of the claim is for goods sold and delivered between27th January and 5th March, 1900. This action was instituted on1st February, 1901. The items are all entered in order in theplaintiff’s daybook, a bound paper book. I see no reason to doubtthe bond fides of that claim. The defendant made payments on
