HIS was an action for declaration of title and for ejectment.
Plaintiff’s title was based upon a Fiscal’s conveyance inhis favour dated 4th August, 1896, and registered on 18th August,1896, which purported to convey the interest of- one Viravaku to theplaintiff. The defendant claimed the land under a deed in hisfavour executed by Viravaku on the 29th April, 1896, andregistered by him on the 30th April, 1896.
It appeared that the sale in execution was held on 20th July,1894; that on the Commissioner refusing to confirm it, his orderwas set aside in appeal on 21st February, 1895; that the order ofconfirmation of the sale was obtained on the 27th August, 1895;that the Fiscal granted the conveyance on the 4th August, 1896;that in the meanwhile the execution-debtor sold the land to thedefendant on the 29th April, 1896. The case was argued upon oneissue only, viz., Whether the defandant’s deed of April, 1896, or theplaintiff’s deed of May, 1896, should prevail? The District Judgeheld in favour of the plaintiff and entered judgment for him.
