A preliminary objection has been taken to this appeal on the ground thatthe bond hypothecating the inpnovable property by way o£ mortgage has notbeen signed before witnesses, and, therefore, does not conform to the provisionsof section 2 of Ordinance No. 7 of 1840, or section 1 of Ordinance No. 17 of 1862or with the practice of the Court. The bond has been signed before the proctorfor the plaintiff. In my opinion the objection is good, and I accordinglydismiss the appeal, with costs.
