4th March, 1897. Lawree, J.—
It is to my mind impossible to find it proved that the accusedpretended to hold the office of President of the Village Tribunal,of Valaieravu, or that he in such assumed character issued forservice a summons.
In my opinion the facts proved would support an indictmentfor committing the offence under section 455—forgery of a docu-ment purporting to be&apos; a proceeding of a court of justice—butthe accused at no time pretended to be Village-Tribunal President,and did no act in such assumed character. I am obliged to setaside this conviction and sentence.
