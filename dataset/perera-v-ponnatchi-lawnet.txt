3rd November, 1897. Browne, A.J.—
Till I read in the evidence in this case that tobacco leaves wereplucked from “ trees,” I never previously had heard that thismember of the vegetable kingdom was a “ tree.” I had alwaysthought it would not be called even a “ shrub,” but only a “ plant.”
• And when in the district wherein it is largely cultivated thelearned .District Judge, without contradiction from parties orcounsel, characterizes the thing grown as “plants,” which must beplanted annually, I must hold his description to be correct, andthat, we are still concluded by the decision in 10,286, Negombo(Nell, 112), repeated in 1,056, C. R. Ratnapura (Ram. 1860-62,p. 101), that a tobacco crop is fructus industriales, and is not aninterest in land requiring that any agreement respecting it should benotarial. As regards the other matters Suggested in argument, I haveperused the evidence and fail to find there exists contradictionswhich would leave me to infer the decision is erroneous.
I would affirm the judgment with costs.
Lawme, A.C.J.—T agree.
