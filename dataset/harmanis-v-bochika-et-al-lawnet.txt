21st February, 1895.’ Lawbie, A.C.J.—
In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. Thesecond defendant, a local headman, admits that the plaintiff’s cowwas entrusted to him to detain it until the damage done by itstrespass was paid. To this action in detinue he pleads that themorning after it was given to him he discovered that the animalhad been stolen from his garden where it had been secured. Theburden of proving that the animal had been stolen and that hehad taken ordinary care of it lay on the defendant. This he didnot attempt to do.
