Discovery of documents—Interrogatories—Trial of issues of law beforeorderingdiscovery of documents—Partnership—Joinder of retired

The defendants moved for an order for the discovery of . certaindocuments. The plaintiffsobjected tothe . discovery sought, on
the ground that certain issues of&apos;&apos;, law should be first determined, andwhich, ifdetermined in their favour, would renderthe discovery
sought unnecessary. The District/^Tudge upheld the objection.
Held, onappeal,thatas ^ there was no preliminaryissueof law
which might dispose of the action, the District Judge was wrongin refusing to order discovery.
A retired &apos; partner . ought, generally speaking, to join as a plaintiff,or be joined as a defendant, in every action to which, had he notretired, he would have been a necessary party.
But if on &apos; the retirement of a partner the debts due to the oldfirm are assigned to the newfirm by writing, as provided by
section 25 of the Judicature Act of 1873, the new firm can sue inrespect of them.
