of premises of which he is the “ occupier. ” Two objections areurged against the conviction—(i.) that, in so far ae the Municipalityof Colombo is concerned, section 94 of the Ordinance of 1865 hasbeen impliedly repealed by “ The Municipal Councils&apos; Ordinance, ■1887 ” (No. 7 of 1887), sections 170 and 171 of which impose the dutyof nlaaning the streets, and for that purpose of providing dustboxes for the collection or rubbish, on the Chairman of the MunicipalCouncil; and X>i) that in any event the appellant, being only anemployd of the real owner of the premises (he was in fact in charge ofthe Grocery Department of the owner’s business, which was carriedon in the premises in question) could not be convicted either as the“ occupier ” of such premises or as an “ inhabitant ” of them withinthe meaning of later words in the same section. In my opinionboth objections are fatal to the conviction. The Police Ordinance,1865, is a general law. Then comes the later and special Ordinanceof 1887. It provides new machinery for the cleaning of the streets,and imposes the duty .of working it on the Chairman of the MunicipalCouncil, which in turn is invested with the power of levying rates onthe community to enable it to discharge its statutory obligations.
In so far as streets are concerned, I think&apos; that, within the Muni-cipality of Colombo, the new machinery has superseded the provisionsof section 94 of the General Police Ordinance. It may well bethat the part of that section relating to private passages, &c.—ground not covered by sections 170 and 171 of The Municipal Coun-cil’s Ordinance, 1887—is still in force. But that is a question whichI have not now to decide. With regard to the second point, I amclearly of opinion that an employd in the position of the appellantis not an “ occupier ” of the premises on which he works; and the useof the words “ his house ” in the subsequent clause precludes himfrom being regarded as an “ inhabitant.”
I set aside the conviction.
