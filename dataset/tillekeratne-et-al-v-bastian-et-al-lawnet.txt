TILLEKEBATNB et al. v. BASTIAN et «l.
D. C. Kalutara, 7,216.
Prescription—Long-continuedexclusivepossession by one co-owner—
Presumption- — Lost grant — Dedication of highway — Ouster —Adverse possession.
It is open to the Court, from lapse&apos; of time in conjunction with thecircumstances of the case, to presume that a possession originallythat of a co-owner has since become adverse.
“It is a question- of fact, wherever long-continued exclusivepossession by one co-owner is proved to have existed, whether itis not just and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case thatthe parties should be treated as though it had been’ proved, thatthat separate and exclusive possession had become adverse atsome date more than ten years before action brought. ”
1 HE facts appear from the judgment.
Bawa, K.C., and De Zoysa, for appellants.—A co-owner cannotprescribe against other co-owners unless he has actually ousted them,or has by some overt&apos; act intimated to them that he is no longerpossessing on their behalf but is possessing adversely to them.
[Shaw J.—Even if a co-owner possess for 150 years, is hesupposed to be possessing on behalf of the other co-owners?] Thatwould not make any difference. Law is not founded on relationship.
[De Sampayo J.—Must not lapse of time shift the burden?]No. See Corea v. Appuhamy.1 None of the co-owners can preventthe possession of the whole land by. one co-owner.
[Shaw J.—The. only question is whether a presumption of oustercan be gathered from the length of time.] There is no. room forthe presumption of ouster here. If an ouster took place it can beproved, as the persons interested are alive and can give positiveevidence of ouster. Counsel cited 2 Leader 74; Morgan Digest 21,169, 273; 7 N. L. R. 91; 10 N. R. 183 (at 186); 3 N. L. R. 213,137; 7 N. L. R. 91; 1 Cowp. 217; 3 A. C. R. 84; Koch 61 and 42;1 8. C. R. 64; Lightwom on .Time Limit of Action 161; IndianLimitation Act 9 of 1908, s. 127; I. L. R. 33 Bom. 317; I. L. R. 35Cal. 961. The Prescription Ordinance has completely repealedthe Boman-Dutch law on the subject. Before Corea v. Appuhamy 1was decided there is no reference in our cases to a presumption ofouster. If there be evidence of exclusive possession for a verylong time, and evidence of something which ought to have put the

co-owner who is out oi possession on his guard, and if he is guiltyof gross laches, then there may be prescription. The evidencemust be strong and convincing, and that is not the case here. SeeBrito v. Muthunayagam.1 If we introduce the theory of fictitiousouster, the decisions become valueless.
E. W. Jayawardene (with him Batuwantudawa), for defendants,respondents.—-Whether possession was adverse or not must be judgedby the circumstances of each case. In 1893, when Tillekeratnebought the property, he did not enter into possession, nor was theproperty included in the inventory of Tillekeratne’s properties whenhe declared himself an insolvent. We were allowed to have exclusiveand notorious use of this land for forty .years, and to take plumbagofrom it.. In 2.S. 0. C. 166 it was held that a co-owner cannot digplumbago without the consent of the other &apos;co-owners. Counselcited also £ C. A. C. 8 and I G. W. B. 92 and 175.
Ouster can be presumed from long and continued possession(2 Thom. 188; 15 C. D. 87). Counsel^also cited 29 Bom. 300; 33. Bom. 317, at 322; 1 S.G. B. 64; Koch 62; 13 N. L. B. 309; 1 Bal.Notes 88; 2 Bal. 40 and 70.
