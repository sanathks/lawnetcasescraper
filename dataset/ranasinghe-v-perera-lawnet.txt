September 6, 1922^ Ennis J.—
.This is an appeal from an order enhancing alimony. It appearsthat the defendant was ordered to pay alimony at> the rate ofRs. 17.50 a month on a decree of separation. The decree was passedunder section 615 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Such a decreecan be altered only where there is an express provision for suchalteration. Section 615 makes provision for an alteration in theamount of alimony on the husband&apos;s application, but makes noprovision for an enhancement of alimony on the application of thewife. I accordingly allow the appeal, without costs.
