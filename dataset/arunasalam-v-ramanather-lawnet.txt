An objection is taken an behalf of the respondent that security in&apos; appealhas not&apos; been given as provided by section 757 of the Civil Procedure Code.The appellant bound himself in the ordinary way in the sum of Rs. 27-60, butat the aid of the bond, which is inaprinted form, there is this farther provisionincluded in manuscript: “ and for better securing the payment of the saidsum of Re. 27-50 I do hereby deposit in cash Rs. 27-50&apos;as per Kachoherireceipt dated July 12, 1921, bearing No. 422.”
I am of opinion that this provision contains a sufficient hypothecation ofthe sum of Rs. 27 – 50 within the meaning of section 757. lids provision issimilar to that in the bond given in Arunaealam Ohetty «. SomaeunderamChewy [6 C. W. B. 274 and 215), in which it was held that the bond containeda hypothecation of the amount in deposit.
I therefore overrule the objection, aid will hear the appeal.
