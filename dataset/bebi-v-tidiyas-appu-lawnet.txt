argument of the appeal, that a so-called admission made by thedefendant to a police headman should not have been accepted asevidence. This objection cannot be sustained- The defendantwas guilty of no offence known to the law. Indeed, it has beenheld by this Court that proceedings under the Maintenance Ordi-nance are not in their nature criminal. {4 N. L. B. 4, 4 N. L. R.131, 1 Bal. 106.) The statement to the police offices could not,therefore, be regarded as being tantamount to a confession.
I dismiss the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
