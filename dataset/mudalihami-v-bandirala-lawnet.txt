MUDALIHAMI v. BANDIRALA.
1898.
March. 4•
0. R., MaUde, 1,763.
Kandyan Law—Acquired property—Inheritance—Property purchasedby son from father.
P’s father sold and transferred certain lands to P. P diedintestate, leaving him surviving a paternal aunt and a maternaluncle—Held, that under the Kandyan Law the lands were theacquired property of P, and as such devolved, unlike ancestralparaveni property, oh the maternal uncle.
HIS was an action in ejectment and for a declaration of title to
certain lands which the plaintiff, a Kandyan, claimed as theuncle and only living heir of one Punchirala, who was admittedby the defendants to be the owner of the lands in dispute.
The issues framed were: (1) Is plaintiff the brother of PunchiMenika, the mother of Punchirala ? (2), Is the third defendant asister of Bandirala, who is the father of Punchirala ? (3) Is firstdefendant entitled to the land as an associated husband (withBandirala) of Punchi Menika, whose son was Punchirala ? And
Has any title passed to second defendant by the alleged saleto him by first defendant ?
After evidence heard, the Commissioner (Mr. Panabokke)dismissed plaintiff’s case by the following judgment:—
“ This is a pure case of Kandyan Law. The issue presented“ to the Court for decision is shortly, whether the property of an“intestate Kandyan who died childless goes to his mother’s or“ father’s relations.
“As the properly in question has descended ‘from the father“ and not the mother, it is clear that it must go to the paternal“ aunt of the deceased and not to his maternal uncle, who is“plaintiff in this case. The case reported on 3 S. C. C. of
“ 12th July, 1878, is exactly in point.
