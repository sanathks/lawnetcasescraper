HIS was an action to recover possession of an undivided
share of the field called Delgahakumbura, which the firstplaintiff alleged she had purchased from her husband, TelenisAppuhamy. The deed in her favour was dated 9th December,1889, and was registered on the 31st of the same month. Theother plaintiffs were her children.
The defendant claimed title also from Thelenis Appuhamyunder a deed of sale dated 27th August, 1888, but registered on30th June, 1890.
The plaintiffs did not prove payment of valuable considerationfor the deed of sale in favour of the first plaintiff, which recitedthat Thelenis Appu, “ for and in consideration of Rs. 200 ” paidto him by Menik Ettana, sold and transferred the land to her.
The Commissioner decided that the first plaintiff’s deed shouldhave preference, and that her title to the field was completed byprescriptive possession. He rejected the evidence of possessionled by the defendant.
Defendant appealed.

22nd August, 1899. Lawbie, A.C.J.—
The plaintiff’s subsequent deed should get priority only if itwas for valuable consideration. It was a transfer by a husbandto a wife. They were, I understand, low-country Sinhalese.Certainly the name of the plaintiff’s husband, Telenis, is that ofa low-countryman.
