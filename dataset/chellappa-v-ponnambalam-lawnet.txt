On appeal—
Civilly, for plaintiff, appellant.
13th January, 1898. Lawrie, A.C.J.—
I am unable to agree with the Commissioner that one of twoco-owners who plants half a land, leaving the other half unplanted,can refuse to give his co-owner half of the landowner’s share onthe produce. Of course, the cultivator is entitled to the whole ofthat share of the crop which by law and custom appertains to theplanter or cultivator, but the owners’ share must be divided amongthe owners in the proportion of their shares.
I set aside, and give judgment as claimed, with costs.
