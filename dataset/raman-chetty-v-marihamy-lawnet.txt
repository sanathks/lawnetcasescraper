EAMAN CHETTY v. MARIHAMY.D. C., Chilaw, 2,035.
1900.July 3.
Appeal—Application for leave to appeal—Lapse of time—Civil ProcedureCode, s. 765.
Where a defendant tendered security for costs of appeal on the last-day allowed for perfecting security and such security was rejected, andthe defendant did not satisfy the Supreme Court that she was preventedby unavoidable causes from complying with the provisions of sections 754and 756 of the Civil Procedure Code, and that she had good groundsfor appealing, held, that she was not entitled under section 765 to haveleave to appeal notwithstanding lapse of time.
EFENDANT desiring to appeal tendered security on the last
day allowed for perfecting security. The plaintiff showedcause against such security being accepted, and the District Judgeupheld ’ the objection. The defendant being unable to tenderother security in time, the appeal fell through.
Schneider, for defendant, moved the Supreme Court for leaveto appeal, notwithstanding lapse of time.
Bonser, C.J.—
This is an application by a defendant, against whom judgmenthas gone, to be allowed to appeal notwithstanding lapse of time.It appears that the would-be appellant tendered security whichwas objected to by the respondent’s proctor, and the Court upheldthe objection. The day on which the tender was made w&apos;as thevery last day allowed for the purpose of perfecting security, andthe would-be appellant had therefore no time to tender othersecurity. No appeal was lodged against the refusal of the Courtto accept the security, and we must assume that the Court wrasjustified in its refusal. That being so, it seems to me that thedefendant has not complied with the first of the conditionscontained in section 765 of the Civil Procedure Code as necessary
