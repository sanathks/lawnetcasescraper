WALTER NUTTER & Co. v. MOHAMMADU LEBBE.D. C., Colombo, 13,813.
Default of filing answer — Purging of default and tender, of answer — Placing ofdefendant on terms.
The illness of the defendant is no excuse for his proctor not preparingor filing an answor in time. To justify the acceptance of an answerafter its due date, it should be proved that the defendant was so ill thathe could not attend to business or see his proctor.
Where the explanation of the delay is unsatisfactory, it is competentfor the Court to place the defendant on terms, and in failure thereof tohear and dispose of the case ex parte.
HIS action was instituted for the recovery of Rs. 2,416 said
to be due by the defendant to the plaintiff on shipmentsof certain goods which the defendant had undertaken to consignto the plaintiff in consideration of moneys advanced to thedefendant on the footing of an agreement set forth in the plaint.
The summons were made returnable on the 31st July, 1900, onwhich day time was allowed to defendant to file answer on the13th August. On the 13th August the time was extended to the16th. On the 16th the court ordered the case to be called thenext day. On the 17th the court recorded as follows:—“ Case“ called; answer due yesterday. No answer filed.
