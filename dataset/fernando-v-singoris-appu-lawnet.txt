FERNANDO v. SINGORIS APPU.Application for restitutio in integrum in D. C. Colombo, 11,217.
Proctor and client—Authority to compromise an action—Limitation of
authority—Notice to other side—Restitutio in integrum—Mistake.
Where a proctor under the general authority given to him bya proxy enters into a compromise with regard to an action, such acompromise is binding, upon his client.
The fact that there is a limitation of that apparent authoritydoes not affect the authority to compromise, unless that limitationis communicated to the other side.
There is an exception to the principle enunciated above, viz.:If before the order is drawn up, the Court is satisfied that thereis some equitable* ground of relief such as mistake or surprise, theCourt will not direct the order to be drawn up, but will restorethe case to the list.
IMPLICATION by way of restitutio in integrum to set aside a
judgment entered by the District Judge of Colombo, basedupon a settlement concluded by proctors on both sides, on the groundthat the settlement was contrary to the instructions of the applicant.
