10th March, 1898. Lawbie, J.—
The accused, a boy of 18, had a quarrel with a younger boy of13. He kicked him. There was no external mark, but probablythe younger boy’s bladder was fully distended. The result of thiscomparatively trifling kick was that the boy suffered from retention• of urine, and his life was in danger for a little time.
