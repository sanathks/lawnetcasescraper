/
■&apos; In this case a toll-keeper at Katugastota appeals against aconviction under section 19 of Ordinance No. 3 of 1896 for takinga toll where no toll was payable under the Ordinance. It seemshe took toll from a carter in respect of Katugastota bridge,although it is admitted that the vehicle did not pass over the &apos;bridge, but went along the high road from Kurunegala to Matale,from which the bridge carrying the road to Kandy diverges. Itappears that the toll station is not on the bridge itself, but isplaced on the side of the road from Kurunegala to Matale justopposite to the bridge. The appellant justifies the exaction oftoll on the ground that the cart passed the toll bar. The answerto that is that the Ordinance does not make the vehicle liable totoll for passing the toll bar, but for using the bridge.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.
