On a writ of execution against H, theproperty was seised on January 21, 1919, and sold by the Fiscal onMarch 17, 1919.

N this case the subject of contention was the title to seven-
eighths of the land called Bogahapitiyawatta with the housesthereon. It was common ground that seven-eighths of this gardenbelonged to Abdul Hameed and Abdul Majeed, the remaining one-eighth being the property of their mother, who was not a party to thisaction. The plaintiffs case was th&t Abdul Hameed and AbdulMajeed, by their deed bearing No. 668 and dated January 20,1919(D 1), which was duly registered on January 21, 1919, sold andconveyed their seven-eighths share to Ana Uduma Lebbe, who,by his deed bearing No. 370 and dated July 29,1920 (P 8), sold andconveyed these shares to the plaintiffs. On the other hand, thefirst defendant claimed these shares as purchaser at a sale in execu-tion against the property of Abdul Hameed and&apos;Abdul Majeed heldon March 17,1919, as shown by Fiscal’s conveyances bearing Nos.19,316 and 19,317, both dated June 11,1919 (D 7 and D 8).
In their answer the defendants, inter alia, pleaded that that therewas no consideration for the conveyance from Uduma Lebbe to theplaintiffs (P 8), and that they were not bona, fide purchasers forvaluable consideration, and that Uduma Lebbe and his privies-in-title, the plaintiffs, were estopped from contesting the first defend-ant’stitle, inasmuoh as Uduma Lebbe was present at the Fiscal’s saleheld on March 17,1919, and made no claim to the shares in question.
The District Judge (W. S. de Saram, Esq.)held that Uduma Lebbewas present at the Fiscal’s sale on March 17,1919, and notified hisclaim to the Fiscal’s Officer who was conducting the sale, but that,inasmuch as Uduma Lebbe&apos;did not make his claim known to thepurchaser, Uduma Lebbe and his privies-in-tifcle, the plaintiffs, areestopped from denying the first defendant’s title, and dismissed the
