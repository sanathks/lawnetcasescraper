BRITO v. .MUTTUXAYAGAM.C. Ncgombo. 9,946.
Antenuptialcontract—Exclusionof coramuoio&apos;bonorum—Gommnnio
quEPstumii—Prescription—Co-owners.
An ante-nuptial contract entered into before Ordinance Mo. loof 1876 came into forceprovidedas follows:“ Thesaid Tangamma
doth herebyrenounceallright tocommunity so faras (he property,
estate, andeffectsofthe saidChristopher Brito are concerned,it
being understoodthat the said Britoshall have, hold,andenjoy
his separatepropertywithout anyclaim thereto on the naTt of vile
said Tangamma."
Held, that the commuuio qiucotuum wasnot excluded bytheabove
clause.
After thedeathofTangamma, the propertyacquired after
marriage byBritowaspossessedby him for over ten years.
Held, thatas thechildren were co-owners with the fatherhis
possession was not adverse, though there were strained relations between fatherand children.
“The question turns on whether Corea v. Appuhamy 1 applies,and that depends on the true character of the interest in theestate, to wit, the half share in communion which on the death ofthe lady passed to the next of kin. If that interest is or is analogousto the interest ofco-parcenary the case applies; if it is amereright
of action againstthe surviving husbandit does not. Inthelatter
case tbedefence is clearly good, whether under the limitation of
ten years as applying to suits in connection with land, or under thelimitation ofthreeyears, whichapplies to all rights of actionnot
specifically dealt with.”
