12th June, 1900. Browne, A.J.—
Section 405 of the old Criminal Procedure Code precludedappeal from a Police Court “ in cases in which such Court passes“ a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding one month, or fine not“ exceeding Rs. 25,” but section 18 directed that “ for the purpose&apos;* of appeal aggregate sentences passed thereunder in case of con-” victions for several offences at one trial should be deemed to be“ a single sentence.” And it was held (1 C. L. R. 10) that appeallay from a conviction and a sentence of one month’s imprison-mnent on each of two counts. The new Procedure Code re-enactsin section 17 (2) the proviso of the old section 18, and thereforethere is here a sentence to a fine exceeding Rs. 25, which takesthe case out of the preclusion of section 335 (1) (g).
I hold therefore that appeal lies. [The case was argued anddecided on the merits also.]
