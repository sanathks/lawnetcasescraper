D. C., Colombo, Cj2,482.
1895.
June 28 andJuly IB.
Ordinance 5 of 1877, ss. 31, 32—Certificate of title—Effect thereof— Settingatide such certificate—Necessity for entry of name of administratorinstead of his intestate—Ordinance No. 14 of 1891, s. 26.
The object of a certificate of title granted under section 31 ofOrdinance No. 5 of 1877 is to make it, unless and until it is impeached byan action under section 32 thereof, conclusive evidence of the title ofthe holder of such certificate to the land referred to therein ; and thecertificate is a bar to the assertion by any one of aDy claim to such land,which arose or accrued prior to the date of the certificate, and whichmight have been registered ; and it is a bar to the claims of persons aswell in as out of possession of the premises.
Any one seeking to set aside such certificate need not resort to aseparate action, but that object may be gained by means of a claim inreconvention under section 32 of the Ordinance, in an action alreadyfiled against him.
Every administrator should get himself placed on the register keptunder Ordinance No. 5 of 1877, as required by section 26 of OrdinanceNo. 14 of 1891, in place of his intestate, and his failure to do so will,under section 31 of Ordinance No. 5 of 1877, operate as a bar to anyclaim by him as administrator.

The plaintiff, who is the holder of a certificate of title of thesecond class to 3-28ths of a certain field, sues the defendant, allegingthat he has been ousted therefrom, and prays for a declarationthat he is the owner, and that he may be placed in possession ofthe share, and for damages.
The defendant, by his answer, alleges title in himself. He saysthat the plaintiff derives title from his father, Johanis Pieris, byinheritance, and that such title was and is a defeasible title,subject to any disposition of the said lands to be made by theduly appointed legal representative of the said Johanis Pieris.
He further alleges that Johanis Pieris died intestate on the 6thApril, 1888, and that Misso, who was appointed administrator, soldand on the 16th of June, 1892, conveyed to the defendant 25-28ths
