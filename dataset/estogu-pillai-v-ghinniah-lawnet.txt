additions to shop by way of sunshades so as to project over the side drain—Evidence of injury to the road.
The words of sub-seetion 8 of section 91 of “ The Thoroughfares Ordi-nance, 1861,” are wide enough to include the case of a person who, havingshelters to his shop alongside of the public road, fixes cadjan tats to theeaves of his roof and lets them down over the side drain propped by twosticks planted in the ground next the drain, so that the tat, thougheasily removable, projects over the outer edge of the drain.
The injury to the road may be in regard to not only its substance orsurface, but also the reduction of the breadth of the thoroughfareavailable for traffic between the side drains.
