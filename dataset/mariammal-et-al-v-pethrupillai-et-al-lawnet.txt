 Thesecondthird defendants disputed the claims of the
seven daughters.
From the year 1909 there has been a series of actions between
the rival claimants npto about the month of October, 1916. These
actions were Nos. 6,683 and 10,109, D. C. Jaffna; and Nos. 6,914/Aand 9,607/A, C. B. Jaffna. –
6. The nett results of these actions were, that the daughters retained5/7ths share of the land, and the second and third defendants gainedthe balance 3/7ths share.
 In January, 1916, the second and third defendants found a friendin the first defendant-respondent, whosuedthe second andthirddefend-
ants for Bs. 600 in case No. 11,043, D. C. Jaffna.
 Thefirst defendant-respondent obtained decree by default,and
went straight up with his writ to seise the 6/7ths share, although thesecond andthirddefendantshad other saleable property, well knowing
thatthe 6/7thsshare wasdecreed to belongto the daughters of
Vitiyanal.
Claims were preferred. The appellant claimed 3/7ths. Their
sister claimed l/7th, and another sister’s son claimedanotherl&apos;/7th
share.
 There were conflicting&apos; judgmentsregarding &apos; the titleofthese
shares. At the claim inquiry, too, the Court below upheld the claimof the one, and rejected the claimof the other two.Threeactions
under section 247 of the Code sprangup.The respondent(firstdefend-ant)wholostthe seizureinstituted case No.11,891/A, and these
appellants and another who lost their claim instituted cases Nos. 12,241/Aand 11,734. Of these three cases, No. 11,891/A went to trial, and theother two were laM by awaiting the result of No. 11&apos;,891/A.
The Court below decreed, and it was upheld by Tour lordships&apos;
Court,thatthefirst defendant-respondent cannotdiscuss the l/7th
share that was in dispute in case No. 11/891/A, on the ground that theaction which led to the execution proceedings were instituted fraudu-lently and collusively.
This case, which is the subject of this appeal, was, after theaforesaid decree, listed for trial before the Court below, and on May 24,1918, it was held that the execution proceedings were bone fide, andthe 3/7ths share of the appellant is liable to be seized and sold under&apos; writin case No. 11,043.
The plaintiffs appealed.
